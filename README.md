> Professional network where your skills are verified by people who actually worked with you.

## The Problem

LinkedIn is theater. Resumes are fiction. We built the first **verifiable professional network** using .cv domains as decentralized identity.

## How It Works

1. **Publish** your professional profile on your .cv domain
2. **AI agents** automatically discover connections between .cv domains
3. **Colleagues verify** your skills through their own .cv domains
4. **Companies audit** candidates instantly with cryptographic proof

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI + LangChain (multi-agent system)
- **AI:** Claude via AI/ML API for skill extraction & verification
- **Database:** Neo4j (graph database for relationships)
- **Frontend:** Next.js + React Flow (graph visualization)
- **Identity:** Ola.cv domains as canonical identity layer

## Quick Start

Coming soon...

## Built For

Hackathon organized by [event name] - integrating Ola.cv, AI/ML API sponsors.
